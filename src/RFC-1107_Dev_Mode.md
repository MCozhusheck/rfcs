## Goals

This RFC describes how the tapplet developers will be able to manually test and verify their tapplets in Tari Universe.

## Problem of testing tapplets

In contrary to web development testing is pretty straightforward - there are plenty tools to build and serve locally project (like babel or vite) and developers can play around by simply viewing them in the browser that also has debug tools.

In a case of tapplet it is impossible as tapplets requires to import dependencies that relies on tauri like `import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";` that is crucial for provider but won't work inside web browser.

## General Solution

To address this problem Tari Universe should enable a `developer mode` where developer can locally upload their work in progress tapplet to the Tari Universe. In a similar manner web browsers also allows to locally test extensions where developer after enabling `developer mode` can upload their extensions.

## Web browser approach

In a case of chrome web browsers it requires to provide a unpacked extension where from now on browser handles loading it to the browser and displaying. It is inconvenient as developer needs to rebuild and upload again extension over any change.

## Proposed approach

Tari Universe displays tapplets using `<iframe>` which make very simple to display locally hosted tapplets. We can use this to simplify developing process by simply providing port of the self hosted tapplet which also enables hot-reloading - developer no longer needs to build project and upload them again.

## UX of enabling developer mode

This feature should be somewhere at the bottom of settings where casual users won't notice as much.
After enabling it, in the tapplet list there should popup new button that reads "Upload tapplet" and after clicking it users can specify folder containing valid tapplet structure. This new tapplet should be displayed on the list available tapplets with a icon indicating that it's locally imported one.
